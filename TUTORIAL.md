# paperHelper User Guide

The first time you use your paperHelper device, you will need to attach a keyboard and mouse.

Go to File>Set House Data and type in the first address. It can have any letters (special and accented characters untested) and can be anything from "645 Main Street 2 Flyers 0 Papers" to "Least Favourite Customer". The program doesn't care. After you have typed it in, click "Add". Type the next address and click "Add". Keep repeating this process until you are done; when you are done click "Apply". The window will close and you go be back to the main UI.

Next, click "Receive Data".
