# paperHelper User Guide

The first time you use your paperHelper device, you will need to attach a keyboard (since it has a touchscreen, mice are optional)

Go to File>Set House Data and type in the first address. It can have any letters (special and accented characters untested) and can be anything from "645 Main Street 2 Flyers 0 Papers" to "Least Favourite Customer". The program doesn't care. After you have typed it in, click [Add]. Type the next address and click "Add". Keep repeating this process until you are done; when you are done click [Apply]. The window will close and you go be back to the main UI.

Next, with the  "Receive Data". It will make sure that you have the correct amount of papers by making you count. Then, the house data will be retreived from the savefile and you can now use it! It will show you the house to deliver to, along with a button "Next". When you have delivered, click [Next] and click [Confirm] because a window will popup making sure that you have delivered the correct amount of papers/flyers to that customer. in future updates during setup it will ask you what day(s) are flyer day and every that day it will tell you flyer info, else it will not. Once it is done it will have a "Complete!" screen with text: "if you didn't have enough or had too much, make sure you delivered correct amount". You can now shutoff the paperHelper.
